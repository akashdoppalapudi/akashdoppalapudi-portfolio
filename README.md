# Portfolio

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This Project is to create my own Portfolio website using **Next.js**

## Project Creation

First we need to have Node and Npm installed in our machine.

To create project...

```bash
npx create-next-app 'project-name'
```

## Getting Started

First, start the development server by running...

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.
You can modify the pages by editing files in `pages` directory.
You can also create or edit components in the `components` directory.

## Styling

I used [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style my website.
